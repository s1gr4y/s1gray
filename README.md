<h3> Hey :) </h3>

I'm [Boris Russanov](https://s1gr4y.github.io/). I'm a master's Computer Engineering student from the University of Florida.\
Whenever I am not reading any docs, working, or learning, I put my side/main projects here. My primary interests are in computer graphics, networking, and data analysis.

I am most proficient in C/C++, but I still have a good deal of experience in Java, Python, and JavaScript.

Feel Free to take a look at my projects/repos!
